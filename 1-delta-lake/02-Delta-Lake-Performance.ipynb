    "Adding partitions to your table is a way of saving data having the same column under the same location. Our engine will then be able to read less data and have better read performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Delta Lake, partitions can be generated based on expression, and the engine will push-down your predicate applying the same expression even if the request is on the original field.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical use-case is to partition per a given time (ex: year, month or even day). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our user table has a `creation_date` field. We'll generate a `creation_day` field based on an expression and use it as partition for our table with `GENERATED ALWAYS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we'll let the engine generate incremental ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Remember that partition will also create more files under the hood. You have to be careful using them. Make sure you don't over-partition your table (aim for 100's of partition max, having at least 1GB of data). We don't recommend creating partition on table smaller than 1TB. Use LIQUID CLUSTERING instead.*"
